I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
I am advised by Dr. Ali Sarvghad and Dr. Narges Mahyar in the HCI-VIS Lab at UMass. 
I am currently working on designing and building visual data exploration platforms for Differentially Private data. 
I am also exploring the fairness of DP algorithms in decision-making tasks. 
Prior to that, I worked as a research assistant at the Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL), 
where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Md. Mosaddek Khan. 
My research activities at CAIL spanned a broad range of real-world problem solving, 
ranging from multi-agent coordination and optimization to planning and scheduling.

I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at TigerIT Bangladesh Limited, 
where I worked as a quality assurance engineer under the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) team. 
I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka.
