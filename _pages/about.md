As a Computer Science PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> since Fall 2022, I am exploring the fields of data privacy and fairness in decision-making from private data. My current research focuses on the design and implementation of visual data exploration platforms tailored for Differentially Private data, alongside an exploration of the fairness implications within Differential Privacy algorithms.
