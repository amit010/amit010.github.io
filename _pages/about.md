I am a Computer Science PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> (Started Fall 2022). I am currently working on designing and building visual data exploration platforms for Differentially Private data. I am also exploring the fairness of DP algorithms in decision-making tasks. Prior to that, I worked as a research assistant at the <a href='https://mmkhansajeeb.com/cailresearchgroup.html'>Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL)</a>. My research activities at CAIL spanned a broad range of real-world problem solving, ranging from multi-agent coordination and optimization to planning and scheduling.

I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at <a href='https://www.tigerit.com/'>TigerIT Bangladesh Limited</a>, where I worked as a quality assurance engineer under the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) team. I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href='https://www.du.ac.bd/body/CSE'>University of Dhaka.

My research interests are:

    <li> Differential Privacy </li>
    <li> Data Visualization </li>
    <li> Multi-agent Systems </li>
