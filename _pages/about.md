As a Computer Science PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, 
I am exploring the fields of data privacy and fairness in decision-making from private data. My current research focuses 
on the design and implementation of visual data exploration platforms tailored for Differentially Private data, alongside an 
exploration of the fairness implications within Differential Privacy algorithms. I am advised by 
<a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar/">Prof. Narges Mahyar</a> and 
<a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/asarv/">Prof. Ali Sarvghad</a> in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hci-vis/">HCI-VIS Lab</a> at UMass.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the 
<a href='https://mmkhansajeeb.com/cailresearchgroup.html'>Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL)</a>, 
where my work encompassed a diverse range of real-world problem-solving. These included tackling challenges 
in multi-agent coordination, optimization, as well as planning and scheduling. More specifically, I applied 
local search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithms for solving Continuous Distributed Constraint Optimization
Problems (C-DCOPs) in multi-agent systems.

I started my professional career as a Software Engineer (QA) at <a href="https://www.tigerit.com/">TigerIT Bangladesh Limited</a>.
During this time, I worked to enhance system reliability and performance 
by identifying essential system requirements and integrating cutting-edge technologies. My focus included the development 
and analysis of methodologies for a contact tracing module aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19. I was also involved in 
designing and executing comprehensive test plans and developing automation scripts to ensure that software functionalities 
met the highest standards of quality.


I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
<a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/body/CSE">University of Dhaka</a> (Dhaka, Bangladesh) advised by 
<a href="https://mmkhansajeeb.com/">Prof. Md Mosaddek Khan</a>.
