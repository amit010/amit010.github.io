My current research focuses on the design and implementation of visual data exploration platforms tailored for Differentially Private data, alongside an exploration of the fairness implications within Differential Privacy algorithms. I am advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Narges Mahyar</a> and <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/asarv/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Sarvghad</a> in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hci-vis/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HCI-VIS Lab</a> at UMass. </p> <p style="text-align:justify"> Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://mmkhansajeeb.com/cailresearchgroup.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL)</a>, where my work encompassed a diverse range of real-world problem-solving. These included tackling challenges in multi-agent coordination, optimization, as well as planning and scheduling. More specifically, I applied local search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithms for solving Continuous Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (C-DCOPs) in multi-agent systems. </p> <p style="text-align:justify"> I started my professional career as a Software Engineer (QA) at <a href="https://www.tigerit.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TigerIT Bangladesh Limited</a>. During this time, I worked to enhance system reliability and performance by identifying essential system requirements and integrating cutting-edge technologies. My focus included the development and analysis of methodologies for a contact tracing module aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19. I was also involved in designing and executing comprehensive test plans and developing automation scripts to ensure that software functionalities met the highest standards of quality. I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/body/CSE" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Dhaka</a> (Dhaka, Bangladesh) advised by <a href="https://mmkhansajeeb.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Md Mosaddek Khan</a>. </p> <p>My current research interests are:</p> <ul> <li> Differential Privacy &amp; Fairness </li> <li> Data Visualization </li> <li> Natural Language Processing </li> <li> Human-Computer Interaction </li> </ul> </body></html>
