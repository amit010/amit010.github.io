<strong>Project Title:</strong> TrackMe: An Android App Implemented in Java for Tracking Personal Vehicles on Road by Using Google Maps API.

<p style="text-align:justify">
<strong>Project Overview:</strong> TrackMe is a personal vehicle tracking and management application developed to 
enhance driver safety and efficiency. This app utilizes GPS technology to provide real-time location tracking of vehicles. It offers several key features: real-time alerts for irregular driving patterns, emergency help notifications, and integration with social media. Users can also view traffic heatmaps and driving history, making it easier to manage and analyze vehicle usage. Designed with a focus on safety and efficiency, TrackMe is equipped with features such as voice commands and route suggestions for optimal navigation. Future updates aim to improve traffic prediction accuracy and expand tracking capabilities to public transport, ensuring that TrackMe continues to be an essential tool for vehicle management.
